## This is the 1st version

## Business Problem
> The data used is fictitious and was provided by DSA (Data Science Academy).

An internet provider offers different types of access plans with different bandwidths. The company then upgraded its infrastructure and would like to validate some assumptions about customers' bandwidth consumption.<br>

The company had data on average bandwidth consumption before the upgrade and recorded consumption in the first month after the upgrade, in the second month and in the month before the upgrade. Data were recorded along with some customer characteristics.<br>

Some business questions were formulated and now we will answer them through 4 hypothesis tests


## Solution Strategy
The Python language was used for problem solving. <br>
The hypothesis tests were the One-Sample t-Test, Two-Sample t-Test (Paired), Two Independent Samples t Test and the Chi-Square Test

## Next Steps
* Accepting suggestions :D


## Disclaimer
A good part of this project was largely done in the Data Science Academy, Big Data Real-Time Analytics with Python and Spark course (part of the Data Scientist training)
